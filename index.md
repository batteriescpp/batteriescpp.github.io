# Welcome to Batteries C++!

Ever get the feeling that there's a lot of nice stuff in other
programming languages that was just left out of C++?  Like the
batteries weren't included?

Batteries is a library designed to fix that!

Features:

- Header-only: makes including/using in your program super easy
- A la carte: only include what you need, don't pay for the rest
- Many useful facilities, including:
  - [Enhanced Runtime Checks/Assertions](/reference/assert.hpp.html)
  - [case_of, an ergonomic replacement for std::visit](/reference/case_of.hpp.html)

<!-- Guides: TODO; adding diagnostics to your program, C++
metaprogramming for humans, using patterns from functional programming
in C++, ...? -->
